These scripts are useful for testing on different versions of Linux
assuming that you are running a version of Linux that has docker
available.

To test against all of the Linux OSes against Apache's master branch:
1. ./run-all.sh apache master

To run the docker scripts:
1. cd $os
2. docker build -t orc-$os .
3. docker run orc-$os
