This is a file to keep the "empty" directory in git repo to remind
developers to avoid manipulating it himself/herself.

This directory is for git-clone, git patch and then build of related git
repo when building related features. Please do not write any files into the
directory if it is empty, and if you are not developing related features
and are not familiar with the related build mechanism you'd better not
modify/add/delete files under this directory.
