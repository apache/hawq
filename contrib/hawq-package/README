Build HAWQ rpm package tarball steps:

1. Prepare a HAWQ source code tarball for rpm building.
   a) Make sure the source code tarball name format is: 
      apache-hawq-src-%{hawq_version}-incubating.tar.gz
   b) Make sure the extracted directory name format is:
      apache-hawq-src-%{hawq_version}-incubating
   c) Put the HAWQ source tarball to %{top_dir}/contrib/hawq-package folder.
      Or use "HAWQ_SOURCE_TARBALL_PATH" to specify the find path of HAWQ source tarball.

2. Install build dependencies of HAWQ, following instruction at:
   https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HAWQ/Build+and+Install 

3. Run 'make distclean' and './configure'.

4. Run 'make rpm' in the top directory of the source code.
   You can set environment variable "HAWQ_RELEASE_VERSION" to specify HAWQ version.

5. You can find HAWQ/PXF/Ranger-plugin rpms tarball as:
   %{top_dir}/contrib/hawq-package/apache-hawq-rpm-%{hawq_version}-incubating.tar.gz
