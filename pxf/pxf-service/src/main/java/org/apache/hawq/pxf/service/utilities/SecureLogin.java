/*
 * This class relies heavily on Hadoop API to
 * - Check need for secure login in Hadoop
 * - Parse and load .xml configuration file
 * - Do a Kerberos login with a kaytab file
 * - convert _HOST in Kerberos principal to current hostname
 *
 * It uses Hadoop Configuration to parse XML configuration files
 * It uses Hadoop Security to modify principal and perform the login
 *
 * The major limitation in this class is its dependency
 * on Hadoop. If Hadoop security is off, no login will be performed
