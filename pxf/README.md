Introduction
============

PXF is an extensible framework that allows HAWQ to query external data files, whose metadata is not managed by HAWQ.
PXF includes built-in connectors for accessing data that exists inside HDFS files, Hive tables, HBase tables and more.
Users can also create their own connectors to other data storages or processing engines.
To create these connectors using JAVA plugins, see the PXF API and Reference Guide online.
