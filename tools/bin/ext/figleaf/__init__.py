figleaf is another tool to trace Python code coverage.

figleaf uses the sys.settrace hook to record which statements are
executed by the CPython interpreter; this record can then be saved
into a file, or otherwise communicated back to a reporting script.

figleaf differs from the gold standard of Python coverage tools
('coverage.py') in several ways.  First and foremost, figleaf uses the
same criterion for "interesting" lines of code as the sys.settrace
function, which obviates some of the complexity in coverage.py (but
does mean that your "loc" count goes down).  Second, figleaf does not
record code executed in the Python standard library, which results in
a significant speedup.  And third, the format in which the coverage
format is saved is very simple and easy to work with.

You might want to use figleaf if you're recording coverage from
multiple types of tests and need to aggregate the coverage in
interesting ways, and/or control when coverage is recorded.
coverage.py is a better choice for command-line execution, and its
reporting is a fair bit nicer.

Command line usage: ::

  figleaf <python file to execute> <args to python file>

The figleaf output is saved into the file '.figleaf', which is an
*aggregate* of coverage reports from all figleaf runs from this
directory.  '.figleaf' contains a pickled dictionary of sets; the keys
are source code filenames, and the sets contain all line numbers
executed by the Python interpreter. See the docs or command-line
programs in bin/ for more information.

High level API: ::

 * ``start(ignore_lib=True)`` -- start recording code coverage.
 * ``stop()``                 -- stop recording code coverage.
 * ``get_trace_obj()``        -- return the (singleton) trace object.
 * ``get_info()``             -- get the coverage dictionary

Classes & functions worth knowing about (lower level API):

 * ``get_lines(fp)`` -- return the set of interesting lines in the fp.
 * ``combine_coverage(d1, d2)`` -- combine coverage info from two dicts.
 * ``read_coverage(filename)`` -- load the coverage dictionary
 * ``write_coverage(filename)`` -- write the coverage out.
 * ``annotate_coverage(...)`` -- annotate a Python file with its coverage info.

Known problems:

 -- module docstrings are *covered* but not found.
