MODULE FUNC.PY : SQL FUNCTION DEFINITION TUTORIAL

This module is designed for being imported from python prompt

In order to run the samples included here, first create a connection
using :                        cnx = func.DB(...)

The "..." should be replaced with whatever arguments you need to open an
existing database.  Usually all you need is the name of the database and,
in fact, if it is the same as your login name, you can leave it empty.

then start the demo with:      func.demo(cnx)
