==================
PyGreSQL ChangeLog
==================

Version 4.0 (2009-01-01)
------------------------
- Dropped support for Python below 2.3 and PostgreSQL below 7.4.
- Improved performance of fetchall() for large result sets
  by speeding up the type casts (as suggested by Peter Schuller).
- Exposed exceptions as attributes of the connection object.
- Exposed connection as attribute of the cursor object.
- Cursors now support the iteration protocol.
- Added new method to get parameter settings.
- Added customizable row_factory as suggested by Simon Pamies.
- Separated between mandatory and additional type objects.
- Added keyword args to insert, update and delete methods.
- Added exception handling for direct copy.
- Release the GIL while making a connection
  (as suggested by Peter Schuller).
- If available, use decimal.Decimal for numeric types.
- Allow DB wrapper to be used with DB-API 2 connections
  (as suggested by Chris Hilton).
- Made private attributes of DB wrapper accessible.
- Dropped dependence on mx.DateTime module.
- Support for PQescapeStringConn() and PQescapeByteaConn();
  these are now also used by the internal _quote() functions.
- Added 'int8' to INTEGER types. New SMALLINT type.
- Added a way to find the number of rows affected by a query()
  with the classic pg module by returning it as a string.
  For single inserts, query() still returns the oid as an integer.
  The pgdb module already provides the "rowcount" cursor attribute
  for the same purpose.
- Improved getnotify() by calling PQconsumeInput() instead of
  submitting an empty command.
- Removed compatibility code for old OID munging style.
- The insert() and update() methods now use the "returning" clause
  if possible to get all changed values, and they also check in advance
  whether a subsequent select is possible, so that ongoing transactions
  won't break if there is no select privilege.
- Added "protocol_version" and "server_version" attributes.
- Revived the "user" attribute.
- The pg module now works correctly with composite primary keys;
  these are represented as frozensets.
- Removed the undocumented and actually unnecessary "view" parameter
  from the get() method.
- get() raises a nicer ProgrammingError instead of a KeyError
  if no primary key was found.
- delete() now also works based on the primary key if no oid available
  and returns whether the row existed or not.


Version 3.8.1 (2006-06-05)
--------------------------
- Use string methods instead of deprecated string functions.
- Only use SQL-standard way of escaping quotes.
- Added the functions escape_string() and escape/unescape_bytea()
  (as suggested by Charlie Dyson and Kavous Bojnourdi a long time ago).
- Reverted code in clear() method that set date to current.
- Added code for backwards compatibility in OID munging code.
- Reorder attnames tests so that "interval" is checked for before "int."
- If caller supplies key dictionary, make sure that all has a namespace.

Some cleanups and fixes.
This is the first version where PyGreSQL is moved back out of the
PostgreSQL tree. A lot of the changes mentioned below were actually
made while in the PostgreSQL tree since their last release.

  returning aggregates in the latest version of PostgreSQL.

Version 3.2 (2001-06-20)
------------------------
Note that there are very few changes to PyGreSQL between 3.1 and 3.2.
The main reason for the release is the move into the PostgreSQL
development tree.  Even the WIN32 changes are pretty minor.

  manipulation of the class structures
- Break decimal out in `_quote` (in pg.py) and treat it as float
- Treat timestamp like date for quoting purposes
- Remove a redundant SELECT from the `get` method speeding it,
  and `insert` (since it calls `get`) up a little.

  (tv@beamnet.de)
- Fix pgdb.py to send port as integer to lower level function
  (dildog@l0pht.com)

  version ready to release.

Version 2.4 (1999-06-15)
