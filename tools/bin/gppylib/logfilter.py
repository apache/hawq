Toolkit for filtering input from GPDB server logs

Module contents:

    ---- High level filters
    FilterLogEntries() - the one-stop filter shop

    ---- Identity filters which observe a stream without altering it
    Count() - count items fetched from a stream
    TimestampSpy() - count lines and note timestamp range

    ---- Grouping and ungrouping filters
    GroupByTimestamp() - group lines with same timestamp
    Ungroup() - decompose groups into lines
    EnumerateUngroup() - number the groups and decompose into lines

    ---- Pattern matching filters
    MatchRegex() - select lines or groups in which a regular expr is matched
    NoMatchRegex() - select lines or groups in which a regular expr has no match
    MatchInFirstLine() - select groups in which regex has a match in first line
    NoMatchInFirstLine() - select groups in which regex doesn't match in first line

    ---- Slicing filters
    Slice() - select items in Pythonesque slice of stream[begin:end]
    FirstNItems() - select the first n items of a stream
    LastNItems() - select the last n items of a finite stream
    SkipNItems() - select all but the first n items of a stream
    SkipLastNItems() - select all but the last n items of a finite stream
    IntersectionOfHeadAndTail() - select items within first m and last n

    ---- Miscellaneous filters
    NotNull() - drop items which are equivalent to False

    ---- Utilities for setting up filter parameters
    filterize() - wrap a filter for use in FilterLogEntries filter list
    spiffInterval() - get begin/end datetime given any subset of begin/end/duration

    """
    Generator to consume the lines of a GPDB log file from iterable,
    yield the lines which satisfy the given criteria, and skip the rest.

    iterable should be a sequence of strings, an already-open input file,
    or some object which supports iteration and yields strings.

    verbose, if True, causes status messages to be written to msgfile,
    which should be an already-open output file.

    For our purposes, a log entry consists of a line which starts with a
    timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.fraction] format, followed by zero
    or more lines having the same timestamp or no timestamp.

    beginstamp should be a datetime.datetime or datetime.date object, or None.
    Log entries are skipped if their timestamp is less than the specified
    date and time.  Fractional seconds and timezones are ignored.  If a
    date object is given, it is converted to a datetime with time 00:00:00.

    endstamp is like beginstamp, except that it causes log entries to be
    skipped if their timestamp is greater than or equal to the specified
    date and time.

    include should be a regular expression object returned by the re.compile()
    method; or a string specifying a regular expression according to the rules
    of the re package in the Python standard library; or a list of such objects
    and/or strings; or None.  A log entry is skipped if there is an include
    regex which - in every line of the entry - fails to match.

    exclude is like include, except that it causes a log entry to be skipped
    if there is an exclude regex which matches in some line of the entry.

    filters is a sequence of callables.  Each callable will be called just
    once, with one argument: an input stream, which will be an iterator
    yielding groups.  (Here a 'group' is a sequence of strings: the lines
    of a log entry.)  The callable should return an iterator yielding
    filtered groups.  The filters are applied in the order given,
    downstream of the begin/end/include/exclude filters.  For example,
    this filter selects log entries with 'DEBUGn:' in the first line...
        lambda(iterable): MatchInFirstLine(iterable, r'DEBUG\d:')
    The filterize() function, defined later in this module, is useful for
    building the list of filters.

    ibegin and jend should be integers or None.  They can be specified like
    the bounds of a Python slice, to select a subrange of the log entries
    which satisfy all the preceding criteria.  Values >= 0 are counted from
    the beginning of the stream; values < 0 are counted from the end of the
    stream.  0 is before the first qualifying log entry; 1 is after the first
    and before the second; -1 is before the last.  Entries coming before the
    ibegin point or after the jend point are skipped.  For example, jend=3
    to select only the first 3 qualifying log entries; or ibegin=-3 to
    extract the last 3 entries.

    Regular expression syntax is at http://docs.python.org/lib/re-syntax.html

    At the beginning of a log file before the first timestamped line there
    could be some lines with no timestamp.  If beginstamp or endstamp
    is not None, any such lines are skipped.  Otherwise they are grouped
    together and treated as one log entry.
