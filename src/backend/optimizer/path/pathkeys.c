 * makePathKeyItem
 *		create a PathKeyItem node
 *
 * Generally, callers specify 'checkType' as false if they know that 'key'
 * is the left or right operand of a mergejoinable comparison whose left
 * (resp. right) sortop is 'sortop'.  In this case, any needed coercions
 * have already been built in to the 'key' expr so that its result type is
 * the same as the sortop's input type.
 *
 * Callers specify 'checkType' as true if 'key' is known to be binary
 * compatible with the sortop's input type but might not be exactly the
 * same... for example, 'key' might be VARCHAR while its sortop expects
 * TEXT.  By convention, a RelabelType node is added to document the fact
 * that the sortop can use the expr result directly without change of
 * representation.
 *
 * [Why not simply strip off all RelabelType nodes from atop PathKeyItem and
 * targetlist exprs?  The benefit of allowing them to remain is still a
 * mystery to me.  I won't try removing them today because it's late in
 * our release cycle. kh 4/07]

 *
 * Adding deduced equalities is useful because the additional clauses help
 * the selectivity-estimation code and may allow better joins to be chosen;
 * and in fact it's *necessary* to ensure that sort keys we think are
 * equivalent really are (see src/backend/optimizer/README for more info).
 *
 * If an equi_key_list set includes any constants then we adopt a different
 * strategy: we record all the "var = const" deductions we can make, and
 * actively remove all the "var = var" clauses that are implied by the set
 * (including the clauses that originally gave rise to the set!).  The reason
 * is that given input like "a = b AND b = 42", once we have deduced "a = 42"
 * there is no longer any need to apply the clause "a = b"; not only is
 * it a waste of time to check it, but we will misestimate selectivity if the
 * clause is left in.  So we must remove it.  For this purpose, any pathkey
 * item that mentions no Vars of the current level can be taken as a constant.
 * (The only case where this would be risky is if the item contains volatile
 * functions; but we will never consider such an expression to be a pathkey
 * at all, because check_mergejoinable() will reject it.)
 *
 * Also, when we have constants in an equi_key_list we can try to propagate
 * the constants into outer joins; see generate_outer_join_implications
 * for discussion.
 *
 * This routine just walks the equi_key_list to find all pairwise equalities.

 * generate_outer_join_implications
 *	  Generate clauses that can be deduced in outer-join situations.
 *
 * When we have mergejoinable clauses A = B that are outer-join clauses,
 * we can't blindly combine them with other clauses A = C to deduce B = C,
 * since in fact the "equality" A = B won't necessarily hold above the
 * outer join (one of the variables might be NULL instead).  Nonetheless
 * there are cases where we can add qual clauses using transitivity.
 *
 * One case that we look for here is an outer-join clause OUTERVAR = INNERVAR
 * combined with a pushed-down (valid everywhere) clause OUTERVAR = CONSTANT.
 * It is safe and useful to push a clause INNERVAR = CONSTANT into the
 * evaluation of the inner (nullable) relation, because any inner rows not
 * meeting this condition will not contribute to the outer-join result anyway.
 * (Any outer rows they could join to will be eliminated by the pushed-down
 * clause.)
 *
 * Note that the above rule does not work for full outer joins, nor for
 * pushed-down restrictions on an inner-side variable; nor is it very
 * interesting to consider cases where the pushed-down clause involves
 * relations entirely outside the outer join, since such clauses couldn't
 * be pushed into the inner side's scan anyway.  So the restriction to
 * outervar = pseudoconstant is not really giving up anything.
 *
 * For full-join cases, we can only do something useful if it's a FULL JOIN
 * USING and a merged column has a restriction MERGEDVAR = CONSTANT.  By
 * the time it gets here, the restriction will look like
 *		COALESCE(LEFTVAR, RIGHTVAR) = CONSTANT
 * and we will have a join clause LEFTVAR = RIGHTVAR that we can match the
 * COALESCE expression to.	In this situation we can push LEFTVAR = CONSTANT
 * and RIGHTVAR = CONSTANT into the input relations, since any rows not
 * meeting these conditions cannot contribute to the join result.
 *
 * Again, there isn't any traction to be gained by trying to deal with
 * clauses comparing a mergedvar to a non-pseudoconstant.  So we can make
 * use of the equi_key_lists to quickly find the interesting pushed-down
 * clauses.  The interesting outer-join clauses were accumulated for us by
 * distribute_qual_to_rels.
