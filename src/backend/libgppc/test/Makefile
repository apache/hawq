# Makefile for src/backend/libgppc test
#
# This directory is for simple regression test for one GPDB release, plus
# one-compile multi-backend test.  Set USE_PGXS=1 to build against
# installed GPDB with pg_config, otherwise it's built with source tree.
#
# Since we keep the source identical between different GPDB releases,
# this Makefile finds GP_VERSION_NUM and runs appropriate test cases only.
# We assume user libraries use PGXS, so this Makefile is a bit too verbose
# as a simple developer example.  Essentially, user libraries can follow
# normal PGXS convention except PG_CPPFLAGS and SHLIB_LINK should be set
# pointing to gppc headers and library.  Or, they can even use only pg_config
# without PGXS.
