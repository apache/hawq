 * Reconcile an incoming versioning event with an existing Global MDVSN entry
 * for the same versioned object.
 *
 * Each versioning event contains the old version and the new version as known
 * by the originating backend:
 *   VE = (key, oldV, newV)
 * Cached entry contains the current version globally visible:
 *   entry = (key, crtV)
 *
 * We have the following scenarios:
 *  - If oldV == crtV, (i.e. VE old version is the same as the current version)
 *     then nobody else has modified the object since the backend read it.
 *     We simply update the entry with the new version in that case:
 *       entry = (key, crtV) --> entry = (key, newV)
 *
 *  - If oldV < crtV, (i.e. VE old version is different than the current version)
 *     some other backend must have modified the object in the meantime.
 *    We generate an entirely new version new_newV for the object to reflect
 *     the new "combined" object.
 *
 *    The cached entry is updated directly with the new version:
 *        entry = (key, crtV) --> entry = (key, new_newV)
 *
 *    The versioning event in the queue is updated directly:
         VE = (key, oldV, newV)  --> VE = (key, crtV, new_newV)
 *
 *  event: The event containing the versioning information for an update
 *  cached_entry: The existing entry for this object in the Global MDVSN
 *
 * This function is called while the MDVerWriteLock is held in exclusive
 * mode. Don't do anything that is not allowed while holding a LWLock
 * (e.g. allocate memory, or call unsafe functions).
