/* ---------------
 *		window node
 *
 * A Window node implements window functions over zero or more
 * ordering/framing specifications within a partition specification on
 * appropriately ordered input.
 * 
 * For example, if there are window functions
 * 
 *   over (partition by a,b orderby c) and 
 *   over (partition by a,b order by c,d,e)
 * 
 * then the input (outer plan) of the window node will be sorted by
 * (a,b,c,d,e) -- the common partition key (a,b) and the partial
 * ordering keys (c) and (d,e).
 * 
 * A Window node contains no direct information about the window
 * functions it computes.  Those functions are found by scanning
 * the node's targetlist for WindowRef nodes during executor startup.
 * There need not be any, but there's no good reason for the planner
 * to construct a Window node without at least one WindowRef.
 * 
 * A WindowRef is related to its Window node by the fact that it is
 * contained by it.  It may also be related to a particular WindowKey
 * node in the windowKeys list.  The WindowRef field winlevel is the
 * position (counting from 0) of its WindowKey.  If winlevel equals
 * the length of the windowKeys list, than it has not WindowKey an
 * applied to the unordered partition as a whole.
 * 
 * A WindowKey specifies a partial ordering key.  It may optionally
 * specify framing.  The actual ordering key at a given level is the
 * concatenation of the partial ordering keys prior to and including
 * that level.
 * 
 * For example, the ordering key for the WindowKey in position 2 of
 * the windowKeys list is the concatenation of the partial keys found
 * in positions 0 through 2. *
