/*
 * We currently support three types of shared-invalidation messages: one that
 * invalidates an entry in a catcache, one that invalidates a relcache entry,
 * and one that invalidates an smgr cache entry.  More types could be added
 * if needed.  The message type is identified by the first "int16" field of
 * the message struct.	Zero or positive means a catcache inval message (and
 * also serves as the catcache ID field).  -1 means a relcache inval message.
 * -2 means an smgr inval message.	Other negative values are available to
 * identify other inval message types.
 *
 * Catcache inval events are initially driven by detecting tuple inserts,
 * updates and deletions in system catalogs (see CacheInvalidateHeapTuple).
 * An update generates two inval events, one for the old tuple and one for
 * the new --- this is needed to get rid of both positive entries for the
 * old tuple, and negative cache entries associated with the new tuple's
 * cache key.  (This could perhaps be optimized down to one event when the
 * cache key is not changing, but for now we don't bother to try.)  Note that
 * the inval events themselves don't actually say whether the tuple is being
 * inserted or deleted.
 *
 * Note that some system catalogs have multiple caches on them (with different
 * indexes).  On detecting a tuple invalidation in such a catalog, separate
 * catcache inval messages must be generated for each of its caches.  The
 * catcache inval messages carry the hash value for the target tuple, so
 * that the catcache only needs to search one hash chain not all its chains,
 * and so that negative cache entries can be recognized with good accuracy.
 * (Of course this assumes that all the backends are using identical hashing
 * code, but that should be OK.)
