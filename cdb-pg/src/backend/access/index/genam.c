/* ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *		general access method routines
 *
 *		All indexed access methods use an identical scan structure.
 *		We don't know how the various AMs do locking, however, so we don't
 *		do anything about that here.
 *
 *		The intent is that an AM implementor will define a beginscan routine
 *		that calls RelationGetIndexScan, to fill in the scan, and then does
 *		whatever kind of locking he wants.
 *
 *		At the end of a scan, the AM's endscan routine undoes the locking,
 *		but does *not* call IndexScanEnd --- the higher-level index_endscan
 *		routine does that.	(We can't do it in the AM because index_endscan
 *		still needs to touch the IndexScanDesc after calling the AM.)
 *
 *		Because of this, the AM does not have a choice whether to call
 *		RelationGetIndexScan or not; its beginscan routine must return an
 *		object made by RelationGetIndexScan.  This is kinda ugly but not
 *		worth cleaning up now.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------

 *	RelationGetIndexScan -- Create and fill an IndexScanDesc.
 *
 *		This routine creates an index scan structure and sets its contents
 *		up correctly. This routine calls AMrescan to set up the scan with
 *		the passed key.
 *
 *		Parameters:
 *				indexRelation -- index relation for scan.
 *				nkeys -- count of scan keys.
 *				key -- array of scan keys to restrict the index scan.

 *		Returns:

 *		heap-or-index-scan access to system catalogs
 *
 *		These functions support system catalog accesses that normally use
 *		an index but need to be capable of being switched to heap scans
 *		if the system indexes are unavailable.
 *
 *		The specified scan keys must be compatible with the named index.
 *		Generally this means that they must constrain either all columns
 *		of the index, or the first K columns of an N-column index.
 *
 *		These routines could work with non-system tables, actually,
 *		but they're only useful when there is a known index to use with
 *		the given scan keys; so in practice they're only good for
 *		predetermined types of scans of system catalogs.

 *	snapshot: time qual to use (usually should be SnapshotNow)
 *	nkeys, key: scan keys
 *
 * The attribute numbers in the scan key should be set for the heap case.
 * If we choose to index, we reset them to 1..n to reference the index
 * columns.  Note this means there must be one scankey qualification per
 * index column!  This is checked by the Asserts in the normal, index-using
 * case, but won't be checked if the heapscan path is taken.
 *
 * The routine checks the normal cases for whether an indexscan is safe,
 * but caller can make additional checks and pass indexOK=false if needed.
 * In standard case indexOK can simply be constant TRUE.
