 *
 * NOTES
 *    Historically this table was used to supply every segment with its
 * identification information.  However in the 4.0 release when the file
 * replication feature was added it could no longer serve this purpose
 * because it became a requirement for all tables to have the same physical
 * contents on both the primary and mirror segments.  To resolve this the
 * information is now passed to each segment on startup based on the
 * gp_segment_configuration (stored on the master only), and each segment
 * has a file in its datadirectory (gp_dbid) that uniquely identifies the
 * segment.
 *
 *   The contents of the table are now irrelevant, with the exception that
 * several tools began relying on this table for use as a method of remote
 * function invocation via gp_dist_random('gp_id') due to the fact that this
 * table was guaranteed of having exactly one row on every segment.  The
 * contents of the row have no defined meaning, but this property is still
 * relied upon.
