  <h2>About gpsnmpd</h2>
    <div class="desc">
  <p>gpsnmpd is an SNMP agent for Greenplum Database which implements RDBMS-MIB, as
  defined in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1697.html">RFC 1697</a>.
  This MIB was developed by a group of representatives from different database
  manufacturers, and describes various attributes common to most relational
  database management systems. Because it was designed as the least common
  denominator, it doesn't show very much detail and there are definitely a
  number of things RDBMS-MIB doesn't cover that GPDB administrators would
  be very interested in. Future versions of gpsnmpd will support a second MIB,
  tentatively called GPDB-MIB, in addition to RDBMS-MIB. This GPDB-MIB will
  be GPDB-specific, and will include many more data points of interest to
  Greenplum users and administrators.</p> <p>gpsnmpd has been used on Linux,
  OpenBSD, and FreeBSD, and perhaps other systems. Future versions will likely
  also work on Windows-based platforms.</p>
    </div>

  <h2>Running gpsnmpd</h2>
    <div class="desc">
  <p>gpsnmpd can run in one of three different modes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standalone SNMP agent</li>
    <li>Pass-through sub-agent</li>
    <li>AgentX sub-agent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a standalone SNMP agent, gpsnmpd itself listens on a network socket for
  SNMP queries, and requires the same configuration as the Net-SNMP SNMP
  daemon. SNMP is sometimes difficult to configure, and Net-SNMP provides a
  program called snmpconf to help the user create a suitable configuration
  file.</p> <p>gpsnmpd can also run as a sub-agent in two different ways. A
  sub-agent is like a slave to a master agent; when it starts, the sub-agent
  registers itself with the master to tell the master which parts of the MIB it
  knows about.  The master communicates with the SNMP client, and forwards
  requests for appropriate sections of the MIB to the sub-agent. Pass-through
  agents are actually identical to standalone agents &mdash; the only
  difference is that the master is configured to pass queries through to the
  sub-agent. AgentX sub-agents, on the other hand, don't listen to the network
  at all, and instead communicate with the master agent through UNIX
  sockets.</p>
  <p>gpsnmpd is implemented using net-snmp and libpq, and most of the
  command-line options available are intended to control those libraries. gpsnmpd
  supports the following options:</p>
      <div class="codeblocK">
<p>jtolley@uber:~/devel/gpsnmpd$ ./gpsnmpd  -?</p>
<p>./gpsnmpd: invalid option -- ?</p>
<p>Version PGSQL-SNMP-1.0beta</p>
<p>usage: gpsnmpd [-s] [-b] [-c FILE ] [-x address ] [-g] [-C "Connect String"]</p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em">   -s : run as AgentX sub-agent of an existing snmpd process</p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em">   -b : run in the background</p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em">   -c : configuration file name</p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em">   -g : use syslog</p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em">   -C : libpq connect strings</p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em">   -x : address:port of a network interface</p>
<p style="text-indent: 3em">   -V : display version strings</p>
      </div>
    <p>Perhaps the simplest way to run gpsnmpd is as a standalone SNMP agent,
    as described below. The most difficult part is to write a proper
    configuration file. The gpsnmpd regression tester, gpsnmpd_regress.pl,
    contains a workable sample configuration file, shown here:</p>
      <div class="codeblock">
<p>com2sec readwrite default public</p>
<p>group MyRWGroup v2c readwrite</p>
<p>view all included .1 80</p>
<p>access MyRWGroup "" any noauth exact all all none</p>
<p>agentaddress localhost:10161</p>
      </div>
    <p>Users interested in making more complex configuration files are
    encouraged to read the snmpd.conf(5) manpage. This configuration file will
    create one SNMP community called "public" and grant it read-only access on
    the entire MIB. It will also tell the SNMP agent to listen on port 10161
    instead of the default 161. This is useful for gpsnmpd_regress.pl because
    listening on port 161 would require root privileges.</p>
    <p>gpsnmpd also requires a libpq connection string, so it can connect to
    PostgreSQL. Note that nothing requires gpsnmpd to run on the same machine
    as PostgreSQL &mdash; the agent can easily monitor a remote PostgreSQL
    instance, if the network configuration allows it to connect. The
    configuration string can contain the database name, the host name, the
    port number, the username, the password, and other information where
    needed. One sample configuration string could say "dbname=gpsnmpd
    host=localhost user=gpsnmpd password=pgsnnmpd".</p>
    <p>Still using gpsnmpd_regress.pl as an example, one way to start gpsnmpd as a standalone agent is as follows:</p>
      <div class="codeblock">
<p>jtolley@uber:~/devel/gpsnmpd$ ./gpsnmpd -c gpsnmpd.conf -C "dbname=jtolley host=localhost user=jtolley password=jtolley"</p>
<p>PGSQL-SNMP-1.0beta is up and running.</p>
      </div>
    <p>A user could then query gpsnmpd with a Net-SNMP client program such as snmpwalk:</p>
      <div class="codeblock">
<p>jtolley@uber:~$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public localhost:10161 .1</p>
<p>SNMPv2-SMI::mib-2.39.1.1.1.2.1 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.27645.1</p>
<p>SNMPv2-SMI::mib-2.39.1.1.1.2.10818 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.27645.10818</p>
<p>SNMPv2-SMI::mib-2.39.1.1.1.2.10819 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.27645.10819</p>
<p>SNMPv2-SMI::mib-2.39.1.1.1.2.16384 = OID: SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.27645.16384</p>
<p>SNMPv2-SMI::mib-2.39.1.1.1.3.1 = STRING: "PostgreSQL"</p>
<p>...</p>
      </div>

  The test simply checks a test database and checks each of the seven major
  tables defined in RDBMS-MIB and supported by gpsnmpd for values related to
  that database. The first table checked, rdbmsDbTable, is indexed by the OID
  of the test database in the pg_database catalog table, and that same index
  value gets repeated throughout RDBMS-MIB. gpsnmpd_regress.pl searches
  rdbmsDbTable for the OID of the test database, and then uses it to test the
  other tables.
      <ul>
        <li>rdbmsDbInfoTable</li>
  rdbmsDbTable contains relatively few details about each database, and
  rdbmsDbInfoTable fills out the rest of the details. There will be one line in
  this table for each database, indexed by OID. gpsnmpd_regress.pl makes sure
  this line exists for the test database.
        <li>rdbmsDbParamTable</li>
  rdbmsDbParamTable contains database-specific parameters taken from
  pg_database.datconfig and indexed by database OID. The regression test turns
  off the Genetic Query Optimizer in the test database, which creates an entry
  in the datconfig column. gpsnmpd_regress.pl tests to see if that entry
  exists. 
        <li>rdbmsDbLimitedResourceTable</li>
  rdbmsDbLimitedResourceTable contains the current XID for each database, also
  indexed by OID. gpsnmpd_regress.pl checks this table for an entry for the
  test database
	<li>rdbmsSrvTable</li>
  rdbmsSrvTable contains one entry per database server on the system. RDBMS-MIB
  supports multiple database server instances being monitored via SNMP from the
  same agent at the same time. Unfortunately, gpsnmpd doesn't yet support
  monitoring multiple PostgreSQL clusters simultaneously, so this table always
  only contains one entry, which describes the one PostgreSQL instance being
  monitored. gpsnmpd_regress.pl looks for this one entry, specifically checking
  the contact name field, which it set when creating the database.
        <li>rdbmsSrvInfoTable</li>
  Much like rdbmsDbInfoTable contains information to supplement rdbmsDbTable,
  rdbmsSrvInfoTable supplements rdbmsSrvTable with things like disk usage and
  uptime information. gpsnmpd_regress.pl makes sure a line exists in this table
  for the test database, checking for the number of finished transactions to be
  reported.
        <li>rdbmsSrvParamTable</li>
  rdbmsSrvParamTable contains an entry for all server-specific configuration
  parameters &mdash; in other words, approximately the contents of the
  pg_settings table. This should always contain many entries per database,
  because PostgreSQL has many configuration parameters, and gpsnmpd_regress.pl
  just checks to see that there are several lines in this table.
      </ul>
    </div>
  <h2>Implementation details and other information</h2>
    <div class="desc">
  <p>gpsnmpd is implemented using libpq and Net-SNMP, which includes a templating
  system to generate a C implementation of an SNMP table given the MIB
  definition of that table. Net-SNMP includes all the SNMP protocol code,
  network code, authentication and access control code, etc., and leaves the
  implementer with only the job of gathering the data published in the MIB. One
  important feature of the system used to obtain the SNMP data is that Net-SNMP
  provides a cache for each table implemented in an agent, and each cache has
  an expiration timeout. For most tables in gpsnmpd, this timeout is 60
  seconds, meaning that the data published by the agent are updated at most
  every 60 seconds. Note also that gpsnmpd will only refresh cached values if
  both the timeout is past <b>and</b> someone queries the table in question, so
  a table might go much longer than the timeout value without refreshing, if it
  isn't queried for a long period of time.</p>
  <p>The current version of gpsnmpd implements only RDBMS-MIB, but future
  versions will implement a PGSQL-MIB (which needs to be defined still) which
  will describe a PostgreSQL instance in much greater detail than is possible
  with RDBMS-MIB. RDBMS-MIB describes nine tables, as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>rdbmsDbTable</li>
    Describes each database monitored by the SNMP agent, including vendor name
    and contact information
    <li>rdbmsDbInfoTable</li>
    Describes version, size, and backup information for each database the SNMP
    agent monitors
    <li>rdbmsDbParamTable</li>
    Describes configuration parameters specific to each database
    <li>rdbmsDbLimitedResourceTable</li>
    Describes resources that are known to be limited, specific to a particular
    database
    <li>rdbmsSrvTable</li>
    Describes each server monitored by the SNMP agent (a "server" is, for
    instance, a PostgreSQL cluster) including its vendor name, contact person,
    and version information
    <li>rdbmsSrvInfoTable</li>
    Describes disk, connection, startup, and transaction information for each
    server monitored by the SNMP agent
    <li>rdbmsSrvParamTable</li>
    Describes server-specific configuration parameters indexed by server
    <li>rdbmsSrvLimitedResourceTable</li>
    Describes limited resources specific to each server
    <li>rdbmsRelTable</li>
    Relates each database to its respective server
  </ul>
  <p>Some comments on the above are in order. First, since some of the tables
  contain contact information, vendor names, or other data not normally tracked
  by GPDB, gpsnmpd supports a set of supplementary tables, by default
  kept in a schema called "gpsnmpd", which will track this information. One
  table contains database information, and is indexed by OID from pg_database,
  and the other tracks server specific information.</p>
  <p>Second, since gpsnmpd supports only one libpq connection, it only supports
  one GPDB server in its current version. It is not possible to monitor
  multiple Greenplum Database clusters with one gpsnmpd instance. It is, however,
  possible to run multiple instances of gpsnmpd on one machine to monitor
  multiple Greenplum Database clusters, however the gpsnmpd instances will need to be
  configured so as not to conflict (for instance, configuring each to listen on
  a different UDP port). This limitation means that rdbmsSrvTable and
  rdbmsSrvInfoTable are fairly boring, containing only one entry each, and
  rdbmsRelTable is similarly boring, since each database must necessarily be
  connected to the one server gpsnmpd knows about.</p>
  <p>RDBMS-MIB refers to another MIB defined in an RFC, specifically
  APPLICATION-MIB from <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1565.html">RFC
  1565</a>. gpsnmpd doesn't implement this yet. Specifically, entries in
  rdbmsSrvTable are supposed to be indexed to match indices in
  APPLICATION-MIB::applTable, and the corresponding entry in applTable would
  contain further information about the server, specifically related to
  connections from clients. Because of particular complexities associated with
  implementing this part of the MIB, the connection between rdbmsSrvTable and
  applTable is unimplemented in the current version of gpsnmpd.</p>
  <p>RDBMS-MIB contains two tables to describe limited resources, one for
  database-specific resources and one for server-specific ones.
  rdbmsSrvLimitedResourceTable is empty in the current implementation of
  gpsnmpd, and rdbmsDbLimitedResourceTable contains only one row per database.
  This is because the only limited resource the authors could think of was
  transaction ID (xid). Since xid is database-specific, it went in the database
  limited resource table. Other limited resources, such as disk space, memory,
  etc. are instrumented elsewhere in the MIB, and weren't copied into
  gpsnmpd.</p>
  <p>rdbmsSrvInfoTable contains a row to instrument the maximum number of
  incoming connections seen. Each time the cached rdbmsSrvInfoTable values are
  updated, the number of connections to the database at the time is recorded,
  compared against the recorded maximum, and kept as the new maximum when
  appropriate. But this only occurs when the cached data are updated, meaning
  that the value in this column is not necessarily particularly accurate.
  Future versions will hopefully correct this problem.</p>
  <p>Finally, RDBMS-MIB describes two SNMP traps which RDBMS-MIB agents can
  optionally implement. gpsnmpd does not implement these.</p>
    </div>
  <h2>Future plans</h2>
    <div class="desc">
  gpsnmpd would benefit greatly from more GPDB-specific data, so the next
  major task is to write and implement a GPDB-MIB which instruments more of
  the PostgreSQL database. This will likely include all the system catalog
  tables, as well as many other data points. Also, none of the data in gpsnmpd
  is writeable yet, though SNMP could be an extremely powerful method of
  configuring the database if some of the values were read-write. If some of
  the configuration parameters that do not require a database restart were
  modifiable via SNMP, third-party administration tools could be used for
  configuration of PostgreSQL as well as other network devices and
  applications. Perhaps most interesting are the things gpsnmpd could do with
  SNMP traps, properly implemented. For instance, users could configure gpsnmpd
  to use LISTEN/NOTIFY to signal an SNMP trap. Finally, gpsnmpd should support
  APPLICATION-MIB, as well as connections to multiple GPDB databases.</p>
