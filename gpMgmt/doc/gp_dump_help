DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

The gp_dump utility dumps the contents of a Greenplum database 
into SQL script files, which can then be used to restore the database 
schema and user data at a later time using gp_restore. During a dump 
operation, users will still have full access to the database. 
The functionality of gp_dump is analogous to PostgreSQLs pg_dump utility, 
which writes out (or dumps) the content of a database into a script file. 
The script file contains SQL commands that can be used to restore the 
databases, data, and global objects such as users, groups, and access 
permissions. 

The functionality of gp_dump is modified to accommodate the 
distributed nature of a Greenplum database. Keep in mind that a database 
in Greenplum Database is actually comprised of several PostgreSQL instances 
(the master and all segments), each of which must be dumped individually. 
The gp_dump utility takes care of dumping all of the individual instances 
across the system.

The gp_dump utility performs the following actions and produces the 
following dump files by default:

ON THE MASTER HOST

* Dumps CREATE DATABASE SQL statements into a file in the master data 
  directory. The default naming convention of this file is 
  gp_cdatabase_1_<dbid>_<timestamp>. This can be run on 
  the master instance to recreate the user database(s).

* Dumps the user database schema(s) into a SQL file in the master 
  data directory. The default naming convention of this file is 
  gp_dump_1_<dbid>_<timestamp>. This file is used by gp_restore 
  to recreate the database schema(s).

* Creates a dump file in the master data directory named 
  gp_dump_1_<dbid>_<timestamp>_post_data that contains commands to 
  rebuild objects associated with the tables.
  When the database is restored with gp_restore, first the schema 
  and data are restored, then the dump file is used to rebuilt 
  the other objects associated with the tables.

* Creates a log file in the master data directory named 
  gp_dump_status_1_<dbid>_<timestamp>.

* gp_dump launches a gp_dump_agent for each segment instance to be 
  backed up. gp_dump_agent processes run on the segment hosts and report 
  status back to the gp_dump process running on the master host. 


ON THE SEGMENT HOSTS

* Dumps the user data for each segment instance into a SQL file in the segment 
  instances data directory. By default, only primary (or active) segment 
  instances are backed up. The default naming convention of this file is 
  gp_dump_0_<dbid>_<timestamp>. This file is used by gp_restore to recreate 
  that particular segment of user data.

* Creates a log file in each segment instances data directory named 
  gp_dump_status_0_<dbid>_<timestamp>. 

Note that the 14 digit timestamp is the number that uniquely identifies the 
backup job, and is part of the filename for each dump file created by a
gp_dump operation. This timestamp must be passed to the gp_restore utility 
when restoring a Greenplum database.

*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-a
--data-only


Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions).


-s
--schema-only

Dump only the object definitions (schema), not data.


-c
--clean

Output commands to clean (drop) database objects prior to (the commands for) 
creating them.


-d
--inserts

Dump data as INSERT commands (rather than COPY). This will make restoration 
very slow; it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into 
non-PostgreSQL based databases. Note that the restore may fail altogether 
if you have rearranged column order. The -D option is safer, though slower. 


-D
--column-inserts

Dump data as INSERT commands with explicit column names 
(INSERT INTO table (column, ...) VALUES ...). This will make restoration 
very slow; it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into 
non-PostgreSQL based databases.


-n <schema>
--schema=<schema>

Dumps the contents of the named schema only. If this option is not 
specified, all non-system schemas in the target database will be dumped.
Caution: In this mode, gp_dump makes no attempt to dump any other 
database objects that objects in the selected schema may depend upon. 
Therefore, there is no guarantee that the results of a single-schema 
dump can be successfully restored by themselves into a clean database.
You cannot backup system catalog schemas (such as pg_catalog) with gp_dump.


-o
--oids

Dump object identifiers (OIDs) as part of the data for every table. 
Use of OIDs is not recommended in Greenplum, so this option should 
not be used if restoring data to another Greenplum Database installation.


-O
--no-owner

Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match the 
original database. By default, gp_dump issues ALTER OWNER or 
SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION statements to set ownership of created 
database objects. These statements will fail when the script is 
run unless it is started by a superuser (or the same user that 
owns all of the objects in the script). To make a script that can 
be restored by any user, but will give that user ownership of all 
the objects, specify -O.


-t table | --table=table

Dump only tables (or views or sequences) matching the table pattern. 
Multiple tables can be selected by writing multiple -t switches. 
Also, the table parameter is interpreted as a pattern according to the 
same rules used by psql’s \d commands, so multiple tables can also be 
selected by writing wildcard characters in the pattern. When using 
wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to prevent the 
shell from expanding the wildcards. The -n and -N switches have no 
effect when -t is used, because tables selected by -t will be dumped 
regardless of those switches, and non-table objects will not be dumped.

Note: When -t is specified, pg_dump makes no attempt to dump any other 
database objects that the selected table(s) may depend upon. 
Therefore, there is no guarantee that the results of a specific-table 
dump can be successfully restored by themselves into a clean database.

Note: -t cannot be used to specify a child table partition. To dump a 
partitioned table, you must specify the parent table name.


-T table | --exclude-table=table

Do not dump any tables matching the table pattern. The pattern is 
interpreted according to the same rules as for -t. -T can be given 
more than once to exclude tables matching any of several patterns. 
When both -t and -T are given, the behavior is to dump just the tables 
that match at least one -t switch but no -T switches. If -T appears 
without -t, then tables matching -T are excluded from what is otherwise 
a normal dump.


-x
--no-privileges
--no-acl

Prevents the dumping of access privileges (GRANT/REVOKE commands).


-h <hostname>
--host=<hostname>

The host name of the master host. If not provided, the value of 
$PGHOST or the local host is used.


-p <port>
--port=<port>

The master port. If not provided, the value of $PGPORT or the 
port number provided at compile time is used.


-U <username>
--username=<user>

The database super user account name, for example bgadmin. 
If not provided, the value of $PGUSER or the current OS 
user name is used.


-W
Forces a password prompt. This will happen automatically if 
the server requires password authentication.


-i
--ignore-version

Ignores a version mismatch between gp_dump and the database server.


-v
--verbose


Specifies verbose mode. This will cause gp_dump to output detailed 
object comments and start/stop times to the dump file, and progress 
messages to standard error.


--gp-c

Use gzip for inline compression.


--gp-d=<directoryname>

Specifies the relative or absolute path where the backup files 
will be placed on each host. If this is a relative path, it is 
considered to be relative to the data directory. If the path does 
not exist, it will be created, if possible. If not specified, 
defaults to the data directory of each instance to be backed up. 
Using this option may be desirable if each segment host has multiple 
segment instances  it will create the dump files in a centralized location.


--gp-r=<reportfile>

Specifies the full path name where the backup job report file will be 
placed on the master host. If not specified, defaults to the master 
data directory or the current directory if running remotely.


--gp-s=<dbid> (backup certain segments)

Specifies the set of active segment instances to back up with a 
comma-separated list of the segments dbid. The default is to 
backup all active segment instances.


<database_name>

Required. The name of the database you want to dump. If not specified, 
the value of $PGDATABASE will be used. The database name must be 
stated last after all other options have been specified.


-? | --help

Displays the online help.


--version

Displays the version of this script.
