COMMAND NAME: gpfilespace

Creates a filespace using a configuration file that defines 
per-segment file system locations. Filespaces describe the 
physical file system resources to be used by a tablespace.

SYNOPSIS
*****************************************************

gpfilespace [<connection_option> ...] [-l <logfile_directory>] 
            [-o [<output_fs_config_file>]]

gpfilespace [<connection_option> ...] [-l <logfile_directory>] 
            -c <fs_config_file>

gpfilespace -v | -?


*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

A tablespace requires a file system location to store its database 
files. In HAWQ, the master and each segment needs its own distinct
storage location. This collection of file system locations for all
components in a HAWQ system is referred to as a filespace.
Once a filespace is defined, it can be used by one or more
tablespaces.

When used with the -o option, the gpfilespace utility looks up your 
system configuration information in the HAWQ catalog tables and
prompts you for the appropriate file system locations needed to
create the filespace. It then outputs a configuration file that
can be used to create a filespace. If a file name is not
specified, a gpfilespace_config_<#> file will be created in the
current directory by default.  

Once you have a configuration file, you can run gpfilespace with 
the -c option to create the filespace in HAWQ.

*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-c | --config <fs_config_file>

 A configuration file containing:
 * An initial line denoting the new filespace name. For example:
   filespace:myfs
 * One line each for the master, the primary segments. A line
   describes a file system location that a particular segment
   database instance should use as its data directory location
   to store database files associated with a tablespace. Each line
   is in the format of:
   <hostname>:<dbid>:/<filesystem_dir>/<seg_datadir_name>
   
-l | --logdir <logfile_directory>

 The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs.


-o | --output <output_file_name>

 The directory location and file name to output the generated 
 filespace configuration file. You will be prompted to enter a 
 name for the filespace, a master file system location, the 
 primary segment file system locations, and the mirror segment 
 file system locations. For example, if your configuration has 
 2 primary and 2 mirror segments per host, you will be prompted 
 for a total of 5 locations (including the master). The file 
 system locations must exist on all hosts in your system prior 
 to running the gpfilespace utility. The utility will designate 
 segment-specific data directories within the location(s) you 
 specify, so it is possible to use the same location for multiple 
 segments. However, primaries and mirrors cannot use the same 
 location. After the utility creates the configuration file, you 
 can manually edit the file to make any required changes to the 
 filespace layout before creating the filespace in HAWQ.

-v | --version (show utility version)

 Displays the version of this utility.


-? | --help (help)

 Displays the utility usage and syntax.


****************************
CONNECTION OPTIONS
****************************

-h host | --host host

 The host name of the machine on which the HAWQ master 
 database server is running. If not specified, reads from 
 the environment variable PGHOST or defaults to localhost.


-p port | --port port

 The TCP port on which the HAWQ master database server 
 is listening for connections. If not specified, reads from 
 the environment variable PGPORT or defaults to 5432.


-U username | --username superuser_name

 The database superuser role name to connect as. If not 
 specified, reads from the environment variable PGUSER or 
 defaults to the current system user name. Only database 
 superusers are allowed to create filespaces.


-W | --password

 Force a password prompt.

Note: gpfilespace, showfilespace, showtempfilespace, 
movetransfilespace, showtransfilespace, movetempfilespace 
are not supported.

*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************

Create a filespace configuration file. You will be prompted to 
enter a name for the filespace, choose a file system name, file
replica number, and a DFS URL for store data.

 $ gpfilespace -o .
 Enter a name for this filespace
 > example_hdfs

 Available filesystem name:
 filesystem: hdfs
 Choose filesystem name for this filespace

 > hdfs

 Enter replica num for filespace. If 0, default replica num is used (default=3)
 >3 

 Checking your configuration:
 Your system has 1 hosts with 2 primary segments per host.

 Configuring hosts: [sdw1]

 Please specify the DFS location for the segments (for example: localhost:9000/fs)
 location> 127.0.0.1:9000/hdfs

 ***************************************
 Example filespace configuration file:

 filespace:example_hdfs
 fsysname:hdfs
 fsreplica:3
 sdw1:1:/data1/master/hdfs_b/gpseg-1
 sdw1:2:[127.0.0.1:9000/hdfs/gpseg0]
 sdw1:3:[127.0.0.1:9000/hdfs/gpseg1]


Execute the configuration file to create the filespace 
in GPSQL:

 $ gpfilespace -c gpfilespace_config_1
