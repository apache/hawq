*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

The gpstart utility is used to start the Greenplum Database server 
processes. When you start a Greenplum Database system, you are 
actually starting several postgres database server listener processes 
at once (the master and all of the segment instances). The gpstart utility 
handles the startup of the individual instances. Each instance is started 
in parallel.

The first time an administrator runs gpstart, the utility creates a hosts 
cache file named .gphostcache in the user’s home directory. Subsequently, 
the utility uses this list of hosts to start the system more efficiently. 
If new hosts are added to the system, you must manually remove this file 
from the gpadmin user’s home directory. The utility will create a new hosts 
cache file at the next startup.

Before you can start a Greenplum Database system, you must have initialized 
the system using gpinitsystem first.


*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-a (do not prompt)

Do not prompt the user for confirmation.


-B <parallel_processes>

The number of segments to start in parallel. If not specified, 
the utility will start up to 60 parallel processes depending on 
how many segment instances it needs to start.


-d <master_data_directory>

Optional. The master host data directory. If not specified, 
the value set for $MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY will be used.


-l <logfile_directory>

The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs.


-m (master only)

Optional. Starts the master instance only, which may be necessary 
for maintenance tasks. This mode only allows connections to the master 
in utility mode. For example:

PGOPTIONS='-c gp_session_role=utility' psql

Note that starting the system in master-only mode is only advisable
under supervision of Greenplum support.  Improper use of this option
may lead to a split-brain condition and possible data loss.


-q (no screen output)

Run in quiet mode. Command output is not displayed on the screen, 
but is still written to the log file.


-R (restricted mode)

Starts Greenplum Database in restricted mode (only database superusers 
are allowed to connect).


-t | --timeout <number_of_seconds>

Specifies a timeout in seconds to wait for a segment instance to 
start up. If a segment instance was shutdown abnormally (due to 
power failure or killing its postgres database listener process, 
for example), it may take longer to start up due to the database 
recovery and validation process. If not specified, the default timeout 
is 60 seconds.


-v (verbose output)

Displays detailed status, progress and error messages output by the utility.


-y (do not start standby master)

Optional. Do not start the standby master host. The default is to start 
the standby master host and synchronization process.


-? | -h | --help (help)

Displays the online help.


--version (show utility version)

Displays the version of this utility.
