# FILE NAME: gpinitsystem_singlenode

# A configuration file is needed by the gpinitsystem utility.
# This sample file initializes a Greenplum Database Single Node
# Edition (SNE) system with one master and  two segment instances 
# on the local host. This file is referenced when you run gpinitsystem.

# REQUIRED PARAMETERS
################################################

# A name for the array you are configuring. You can use any name you 
# like. Enclose the name in quotes if the name contains spaces.

ARRAY_NAME="GPDB SINGLENODE"


# This specifies the file that contains the list of segment host names 
# that comprise the Greenplum system. For a single-node system, this
# file contains the local OS-configured hostname (as output by the 
# hostname command). If the file does not reside in the same 
# directory where the gpinitsystem utility is executed, specify 
# the absolute path to the file.

MACHINE_LIST_FILE=./hostlist_singlenode


# This specifies a prefix that will be used to name the data directories 
# of the master and segment instances. The naming convention for data 
# directories in a Greenplum Database system is SEG_PREFIX<number> 
# where <number> starts with 0 for segment instances and the master 
# is always -1. So for example, if you choose the prefix gpsne, your 
# master instance data directory would be named gpsne-1, and the segment 
# instances would be named gpsne0, gpsne1, gpsne2, gpsne3, and so on.

SEG_PREFIX=gpsne


# Base port number on which primary segment instances will be 
# started on a segment host. The base port number will be 
# incremented by one for each segment instance started on a host. 

PORT_BASE=40000


# This specifies the data storage location(s) where the script will 
# create the primary segment data directories. The script creates a 
# unique data directory for each segment instance. If you want multiple 
# segment instances per host, list a data storage area for each primary 
# segment you want created. The recommended number is one primary segment
# per CPU. It is OK to list the same data storage area multiple times 
# if you want your data directories created in the same location. The 
# number of data directory locations specified will determine the number 
# of primary segment instances created per host.
# You must make sure that the user who runs gpinitsystem (for example, 
# the gpadmin user) has permissions to write to these directories. You 
# may want to create these directories on the segment hosts before running 
# gpinitsystem and chown them to the appropriate user.

declare -a DATA_DIRECTORY=(/gpdata1 /gpdata2)


# The OS-configured hostname of the Greenplum Database master instance.

MASTER_HOSTNAME=hostname_of_machine


# The location where the data directory will be created on the  
# Greenplum master host. 
# You must make sure that the user who runs gpinitsystem
# has permissions to write to this directory. You may want to 
# create this directory on the master host before running 
# gpinitsystem and chown it to the appropriate user.

MASTER_DIRECTORY=/gpmaster


# The port number for the master instance. This is the port number 
# that users and client connections will use when accessing the 
# Greenplum Database system.

MASTER_PORT=5432


# The shell the gpinitsystem script uses to execute 
# commands on remote hosts. Allowed value is ssh. You must set up 
# your trusted host environment before running the gpinitsystem 
# script. You can use gpssh-exkeys to do this.

TRUSTED_SHELL=ssh


# Maximum distance between automatic write ahead log (WAL) 
# checkpoints, in log file segments (each segment is normally 16 
# megabytes). This will set the checkpoint_segments parameter 
# in the postgresql.conf file for each segment instance in the 
# Greenplum Database system.

CHECK_POINT_SEGMENTS=8


# The character set encoding to use. Greenplum supports the 
# same character sets as PostgreSQL. See 'Character Set Support'
# in the PostgreSQL documentation for allowed character sets.
# Should correspond to the OS locale specified with the 
# gpinitsystem -n option. 

ENCODING=UNICODE
