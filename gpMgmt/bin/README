For Developers
==============

If you'd like to run the python scripts directly from this 
directory you will need to modify your PYTHONPATH variable to add the "ext" 
directory.  so something like:

	export PYTHONPATH=~/dev/cdb2/gpMgmt/bin/ext

should do the trick.


Python Version
--------------

* The current utilities bundle python 2.5.1.  We are planning on moving 
  forward to 2.6.1 in the near future.


Where Things Go
---------------

* We are trying to eliminate the "lib" directory here.  If you are adding a GP
  module please add it to the gppylib dir.  If you are adding a 3rd party
  module please add it to the ext dir.  Please follow this as removing
  the use of lib/gplib.py and lib/gpmlib.py can be difficult.
